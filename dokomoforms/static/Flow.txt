Quick description of application flow.


There are three levels of components

Application
 |
  ---> View Controllers
         |
         ---> Base Views

The application consists of three main view controllers, Footer, Content,
Header.

Content can be one of a few View Controllers (Question, Splash, Submit, etc)

Application can alter localStorage at whim, they handle all external
communication and all initilization of databases.

View Controllers only alter their own local states and localStorage for their
specific question ID. They can also push to their designated database and
facilityTree.

Base Views are dumb, they do nothing other then handle their own localState and
fire callbacks that are passed into them.

The application also uses references to refer to active questions, footer and
header sections. This is a react concept that lets you access class methods for
active components. I rarely use this but it is something that can be done


Almost all ram state in the View Controllers and below are just used for
visiualization purposes, everything else is stored in localStorage.

Application stores db accessors and facilityTree references in RAM however. This
is not an issue mostly (accept for the facilityTree case which should fallback
to a local copy which hopefully i will do ASAPPPP)


Question logic like branching/required is only enforce on next/prev button
checks. Validation is checked in the baseComponents as users type out values


Branching is handled with a stack of doubly linked lists (pointers let you know
what question is next and what is prev). On a branch, copy of the linked list is
stored on the stack and the other is modified to add in all the nodes that are a
part of this branch. When you move back into a branching question, the stack is
popped and set as the active linked list, reverting any changes made to the
surveys question ordering. Submission resets linked list entirely to original
state. 


Facilities are retrieved compressed from Revisit based on logic in facility
question nodes, a new tree is created for every facility question. Overlaping
tree nodes have their facilities stored in the same location so nothing is
duplicated.
