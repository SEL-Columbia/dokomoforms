<p>
<strong>2.2 Type Constraint / Answer Type</strong>
<br />
Specifies the type of answer that must be given. Answers that are not compatible with the type constraint will not be accepted. Options are:
<ul>
	<li>
	<strong>Text</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Integer</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Decimal</strong>
	</li>

	<strong>Date</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Time</strong>
	<br />
	</li>
</ul>

<strong>2.2.1 Multiple Choice</strong>
<br />
If the survey author chooses 'multiple choice' as a question's type constraint, they must provide a list of choices for the survey recepient to choose from. At least two
choices must be given.
<br />
By choosing the "allow other" option, the survey author can allow the survey recepient to choose "other" as an answer if none of the given answers are applicable.

<p>
<strong>2.3 Question Hint (optional)</strong>
<br />
The question hint. Can be used to indicate expected answer type, if multiple responses can be given, etc.

<p><strong>3. Sub-Surveys</strong>
<br />
A sub-survey is a list of questions that branches off its parent survey.
<p>
<strong>Usage:</strong>
<strong>Buckets: </strong>The survey author can indicate a specific answer (in the case of a multiple choice question) or range of answers (in the case of integer, decimal, time, or date question) that if chosen, can lead to the sub-survey. This specified answer is referred to as a bucket. Skip to section 4 for more information on buckets.
<br />
For example, if the question is "do you have children?" the survey author can indicate that answering "yes" is a bucket to a sub-survey of questions that asks about the survey recepient's children. After the sub-survey is completed, the survey will automatically skip back to the following question in the parent survey.
<br />If the receipient answers "no", the sub-survey will not be given and the next question in the parent survey will be shown.
</p>
</p>

<br />
In the flowchart above, the questions in red are from the sub-survey, while the questions in blue are questions from the parent survey.
<br />
<p>
<strong>Repeating: </strong>The survey author can indicate that a sub-survey is repeatable. The number of times a sub-survey repeats will be based on the answer to the parent question.
<br />For parent questions with an <strong>integer</strong> type constraint, the sub-survey will repeat the number of times of the given answer.
<br />For parent questions that allow multiple responses, the sub-survey will repeat as many times as there are given answers.
<br />Sub-surveys can not be both repeatable and have buckets.
<br />A parent question can have multiple sub-surveys.
<br />Sub-surveys can not have the same bucket lead to two separate sub-surveys.
<br />A sub-survey can, however, have multiple buckets that lead to it.
<br />Sub-surveys can branch off any survey, including other sub-surveys.
<br />If a sub-survey does not have buckets, it must be repeatable.


<p>
<strong>4. Buckets</strong>
<br />
The survey author can indicate a specific answer (in the case of a multiple choice question) or range of answers (in the case of integer, decimal, time, or date question) that if chosen, can lead to the sub-survey. This specified answer is referred to as a bucket.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bucket Types</strong>
</p>
<strong>Multiple Choice:</strong>
<p>One or more of the choices listed in a multiple choice question. If one of the specified buckets is selected, the receipient will be lead to the sub-survey.</p>
<p>
<strong>Range:</strong>
<p>For an integer or decimal question. If the receipients gives an answer that falls in the range, they will be lead to the sub-survey. A minimum and a maximum in the range must be specified. Minimum defaults to 0 and maximum at 100.
</p>
<p>
Multiple buckets can lead to the same sub-survey, but one bucket can not lead to multiple sub-surveys.
