1. Encryption
  - Column-level encryption doesn't work for our needs at all...
  - Filesystem-level encryption looks best.
2. Behavior-driven/baby's first test-drive development
  - Want the application to conform to some behavior? Write a test stub!
  - E.g. want administrative information to be inaccesible to a regular user?
    - Here's a test stub...

    /tests/user_test.py:

    import unittest


    class TestUser(unittest.TestCase):
        def testRegularUserCannotSeeAdminInfo(self):
            assert False
3. DONE: Figure out clean way to deal with setting up the DB for SQLAlchemy
   (extensions, etc).
4. HTTPS/SSL
  - As per convo with Chris Tan, just tell nginx to proxy 443 traffic to 8888.
5. Internationalization (I18n) of the application
  - Looks like the process has to go something like this:
    1. From the top-level directory of Dokomo Forms run
        $ locale/make_translations.sh {locale}
      This will create-or-update locale/dokomoforms.po and
      locale/{locale}/LC_MESSAGES/dokomoforms.po
      It looks at all the *.py and *.html files for _() strings.
    2. Add translations to locale/{locale}/LC_MESSAGES/dokomoforms.po where
      there are empty strings (or modify existing translations).
    3. Run $ locale/compile_translations.sh {locale}
      This will create-or-update locale/{locale}/LC_MESSAGES/dokomoforms.mo
  - Having done all that, if, say, you have generated
    locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/dokomoforms.mo (Spanish), then someone visiting the
    site with the browser language set to Spanish will get that translation.
  - Maybe we want to do this in the JS instead?:

6. Internationalization of the surveys
  - Firstly do we even want this?
  - How best to store the different translations, keep them up-to-date, etc?
  - Two scenarios I can see:
    1. Send all the translations in the HTML and have a locale switcher
       <select> (user can select language while offline).
    2. Only send the requested translation based on browser settings. (User is
       stuck with one translation).
7. Should we develop the JS code under "use strict"; ?
8. while(1); in JSON responses?

9. Think about what happens to e-mails when account is deleted/inactive.
10. readthedocs
  - tox sphinx
  - https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1263
11. It looks like the various answer types might go in different tables for ORM
    purposes... I should write a SQL view to abstract that detail away.
12. When creating a survey, the creator should be forced to run through the
    survey as a preview, and "submit" to create. This prevents graphs without
    a terminal node, for instance.
13. Consider adding range questions like
    What is the valid age range? (10-20)
    How long does this process take?
